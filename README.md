# Randomness-Frontmatter
---

This is a fork ofr the Randomness plugin with a frontmatter addin for personal needs, other wise its a clone.

Dice, random tables, and full random generators for
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) — built for TTRPGs and creative
writing, simple enough for anyone.

Roll dice in a sentence. Turn any markdown table into a rollable
table. Lock the results you like into your notes forever. And when
you outgrow that, a complete generator engine (the Inspiration Pad
Pro format — twenty years of community tables load as-is) is
underneath.

**Randomness has absorbed the
[Dice Roller](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/dice-roller)
plugin.** Every `dice:` roll, table roll, and tag roll keeps
working — see [migrating from Dice Roller](docs/migrating-from-dice-roller.md).

## The 30-second tour

Roll dice anywhere:

```markdown
The goblin hits you for `dice: 2d6 + 3` damage.
Stats: `dice: 4d6dl1` — advantage: `dice: 2d20kh` — hits: `dice: 6d6>=5`
```

Turn a markdown table into a rollable one by naming it:

```markdown
| Tavern |
| ------ |
| The Prancing Pony |
| The Drunken Goblin |

^taverns

Tonight you drink at `rdm:[@taverns]`.
```

Every roll gets 🎲 (re-roll) and 🔒 (**lock** — the result is
written into your note itself, surviving reloads and sync):

```markdown
Tonight you drink at `rdm:[@taverns]⟹The Drunken Goblin`.
```

## Features

- **Dice** — the full grammar: modifiers (`4d6dl1`, `2d20kh`,
  exploding `!`, re-rolls `r`, success counting `6d6>=5`),
  percentile, Fate/Fudge, d66, custom face ranges. A sidebar
  **dice tray** with pool buttons, advantage/disadvantage, and
  saved formulas. Optional tumbling **dice animations**.
- **Roll your notes** — markdown tables (with column picks and
  dice-lookup rows), lists, random lines or paragraphs from any
  note, and random `#tagged` notes — no Dataview required.
- **Locks** — results are committed into the note text, not
  plugin state, so they survive sync and outside edits.
  `dice-mod:` locks itself on first render.
- **Dice Roller compatibility** — `dice:`, `dice+:`, `dice-:`,
  and `dice-mod:` spans work with Dice Roller's own semantics,
  plus formula aliases and the `|text(…)`/`|form`/`|render`
  flags. Turns on automatically when the Dice Roller plugin
  isn't running.
- **Generator files** — plain-text `.rdm` files (legacy `.ipt`
  loads identically): weighted tables, lookup tables,
  dictionaries, deck picks, variables, conditionals, prompts
  (dropdowns above the output), 21 filters, dice everywhere, and
  tables calling tables — rollers all the way down. The engine
  survives the full community stress-test corpus.
- **Zero-friction sharing** — `Use:` other files or notes
  (wikilinks resolve like Obsidian links), auto-discovery of
  tables by name under your Generator root, and autocomplete
  that adds imports for you.
- **Generator browser** — a sidebar pane with every generator in
  your vault: roll, copy an inline call, pin favourites. Tabs
  for **Portraits** (layered character faces with rolled names,
  via a one-click art pack), a portrait **Builder**, and the
  **Dice** tray.
- **Scripting API** — roll tables from Templater/DataviewJS,
  seeded and prompt-controlled, plus portrait generation. See
  [API.md](API.md).

## Install

1. In Obsidian: Settings → Community plugins → Browse →
   "Randomness" → Install, then Enable.
2. Or manually: download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and
   `styles.css` from the latest [release](../../releases) into
   `.obsidian/plugins/randomness/`.

## Learn it in ten minutes

Open **Settings → Randomness** and click **Install the guide**.
You get a small folder of notes — one per feature, every example
live and rollable — starting from "roll a die" and ending at
generator files. Also on that settings page:

- **Open reference** — the complete syntax reference as a
  searchable note.
- **Add examples** — five commented starter `.rdm` generators.

And the **"Create new generator file"** command makes and opens a
starter `.rdm` for you — no fighting with hidden file extensions.

## For Dice Roller users

Disable Dice Roller, enable Randomness, done — your notes don't
change. The [migration guide](docs/migrating-from-dice-roller.md)
has the full compatibility table and the short list of things that
work differently (mostly better: locks instead of fragile result
saving, tag rolls without Dataview).

## Generator content & licensing

`.rdm`/`.ipt` generators you download from the community keep
whatever licence their authors chose. The plugin does not include
or distribute generator content; the corpus in the dev repo is for
testing only.

## Network use & privacy

Randomness works fully offline. All core features — dice, table and
generator rolls, locks, the dice tray, the reference and guide, and the
scripting API — run entirely on your device and never touch the network.

The plugin only makes network requests when you explicitly ask it to
download optional content, and only to public GitHub repositories under
the [Obsidian-TTRPG-Community](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community)
organisation:

- **Portrait art pack** — clicking "Install portrait pack" downloads a
  release asset from
  `github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/Randomness`. A `data.json`
  override lets you point at a self-hosted pack instead.
- **Starter content bundles** — the optional content installers fetch
  `.rdm` generators and templates from
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/…`.

These are read-only downloads triggered by a button press. Randomness
sends no data anywhere, contains no telemetry or analytics, and never
loads anything over the network on its own.

## Development

Pure-TypeScript engine and resolver, no Obsidian imports outside
`src/views/`. The test suite runs against in-memory file sources
and jsdom — no Obsidian instance required to develop.

```bash
npm install         # one-time setup
npm test            # run the full suite (1,100+ tests)
npx tsc --noEmit    # strict typecheck
npm run build       # bundle for distribution
npm run dev         # watch mode
```

Architecture in four layers:

- **Engine** (`src/engine/`) — pure generator evaluator: AST,
  parsers, dice core with the full modifier grammar, expression
  evaluator with seedable PRNG, 21 filters, recursion guard.
- **Resolver** (`src/resolver/`) — `Use:` graph traversal,
  markdown table/list/line/block extraction, inline scope
  assembly. Synchronous; async backend via `asyncPrefetcher`.
- **Compat** (`src/compat/`) — the Dice Roller syntax translator.
- **Views** (`src/views/`) — the only layer that imports
  Obsidian: codeblock and inline processors, dice tray, browser
  pane, settings, lock/reroll state machine, sanitiser.

Docs sources of truth: `docs/reference.md` (→ `npm run
embed-reference`) and `docs/guide/` (→ `npm run embed-guide`).
See `STATUS.md` for the design log and
`docs/dice-roller-merge-plan.md` for the merge architecture.
