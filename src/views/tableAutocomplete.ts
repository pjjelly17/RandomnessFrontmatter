/**
 * Editor suggest for inline `rdm:` table autocomplete.
 *
 * Trigger pattern: cursor positioned inside an inline code span
 * that starts with `rdm:[@`, `rdm:[#`, or `rdm:[!` (the three
 * inline call shapes that consume a table name). Examples where
 * the popup appears:
 *
 *     Some prose `rdm:[@|         ← @
 *     A list of `rdm:[#5 |        ← # (lookup-pick with reps)
 *     Deck of `rdm:[!nameDeck|    ← ! (deck pick, partial query)
 *
 * On selection, the chosen table name is inserted between the
 * trigger character and the cursor, then a closing `]` is added
 * IF there isn't already one immediately after the cursor (so
 * re-editing a complete call doesn't double-close).
 *
 * Scope: tables visible from the current note — i.e. tables in
 * any `randomness` codeblock plus tables reachable via `Use:`
 * imports from those codeblocks. The same scope `buildInlineBundle`
 * computes for runtime inline calls. Out-of-scope tables in the
 * vault are NOT suggested; autocomplete that lies about what's
 * available is worse than honest emptiness.
 *
 * Why EditorSuggest and not a custom popup: keyboard navigation,
 * theming, mobile, accessibility, escape-to-dismiss — Obsidian's
 * built-in popover handles all of that. Inheriting saves a lot
 * of code and stays consistent with how the user's other
 * autocompletes feel.
 *
 * Caching: building the in-scope table list reads files from the
 * vault, which is async. We cache the result per-note-path on
 * first trigger, then invalidate when the note source changes
 * (cheap — we just drop the cache; rebuild happens lazily on
 * the next trigger). The result: typing past the trigger is
 * fast after the first popup, and edits to the note correctly
 * refresh the available tables.
